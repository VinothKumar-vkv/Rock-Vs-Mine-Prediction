# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

A Machine Learning project that classifies sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** using supervised learning techniques.

---

## 📘 Overview

Submarines, underwater mines, and geological structures all reflect sonar signals differently. This project leverages that fact using sonar data to **predict whether a sonar return is from a rock or a mine**.

- 🚀 Built in **Google Colab**
- 🧠 Powered by **Machine Learning**
- 📊 Dataset: Sonar Signals from UCI Repository

---

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- ✅ Preprocessing of real-world sonar signals
- 🏷️ Binary classification: `Rock (R)` vs `Mine (M)`
- 📈 Algorithms used: `Logistic Regression` / `SVM` / `Random Forest` *(customize based on your actual code)*  
- 🎯 Achieved accuracy: **XX%** *(update this based on your results)*
